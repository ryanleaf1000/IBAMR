Changed: The implementation of FORWARD_EULER provided by
IBExplicitHierarchyIntegrator was misnamed as it was actually the same 'explicit
backward Euler' (i.e., a forward Euler prediction followed by a backward Euler
correction) predictor-corrector method as BACKWARD_EULER. FORWARD_EULER is now
really the forward Euler method. The previous implementation is still available
as BACKWARD_EULER.
